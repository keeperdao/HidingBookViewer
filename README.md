# HidingBookViewer

##Summary
Build an internal frontend and/or python tool for viewing and possibly querying the Hiding Book.

##Rationale
We have no easy way of viewing the order book, especially if you aren't a dev. This would be of marginal benefit to
users and AFAIK never requested so I don't think it's worth the effort to fully productize this.

##Details
Should include:

- All data fields from the HB API
- Dollar/ETH amount of each order

## Implementation plan

Really don't mind. Whatever is easiest.
Could use streamlit (e.g. https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/example-app-interactive-table/main).
